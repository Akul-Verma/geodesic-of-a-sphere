Geodesic is the minimum path along some given surface between two points on that surface only ,
For eg:- a straight line is the geodesic when we have to move along a plane surface between two points along this plane surface without accelerating,

similarly a great circle is the geodesic i.e minimum path for someone who has to move along the surface of the sphere between two points of the
spherical surface.
( here great circle is a circle which have the common center as that of the spherical surface and it shares the boundary with that spherical surface)
